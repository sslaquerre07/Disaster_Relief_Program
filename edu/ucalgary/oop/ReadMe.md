# User Guide ENSF380 IA#3

## This project includes all of the required java files, all interconnected with the OOP implemented throughout the course

## User Interface Guide
Both user interfaces were implemented using the GUI features shown in the Week 12 Videos
* Note: Both types of users can enter DisasterVictims and Inquiries, the main diffrence is that the central worker can enter these things for all locations *
The interfaces are accessible through 2 classes:
---
### CentralWorker.java
By navigating to this file, you can compile and run the main function. This will allow you to pick from either of the two interfaces. From a central worker perspective, both interaces allow for you to choose where your inquiry is being logged, or where your disaster victim is stored. 
### LocationWorker.java
Running the main function in this file will first prompt you to select from all of the current locations in the database. You will have to choose a valid id, if not you will be prompted to pick one again. Once you pick one, you will be prompted with the same two interfaces given to the central worker, with the location already set for database uploading.
